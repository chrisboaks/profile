    <h1>Hi.  I'm Chris.</h1>

    <p>
      I'd always heard that if you have a job you love, you never work a day in your life. And after hearing it, I'd think to myself that it was a shame no one would ever pay me to play sudoku and solve logic puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a while to discover I was mistaken about that one, but ever since I've worked (played?) furiously at learning to code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm now a web developer and coder based in NYC, and I'm seeking opportunities to expand and hone my skills. I work mostly with Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Backbone.js (including jQuery and Underscore), and I love picking up new languages and frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out some of my projects below to get a sense of what I've worked on, and if you're looking for a hard-working and occasionally clever developer to work with, let me know.
    </p>
